## REMINDER

The aim of this project is to create a system that constantly reminds people that work on computer all day to perform some actions repeatedly, like for example stand up from their chari every 10 minutes or drink water.
I think that programming is amazing but staying safe is better :D

## EXECUTION
run `$ python3 wrc/main.py`

## FURTHER DEVELPMENTS
Possible further developments:
