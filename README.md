## REMINDER

The aim of this project is to create a system that constantly reminds people that work on computer all day to perform some actions repeatedly, like for example stand up from their chari every 10 minutes or drink water.
I think that programming is amazing but staying safe is better :D

## DEVELOPMENT
By now, the project creates a test notification and fires it every 5 minutes

## FURTHER DEVELPMENTS
Possible further developments:
1. Creation of multiple notifications sent at the same time
2. GUI for easy notification creation by the user
