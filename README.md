## REMINDER

The aim of this project is to create a system that constantly reminds people that work on computer all day to perform some actions repeatedly, like for example stand up from their chair every 10 minutes or drink water.
I think that programming is amazing but staying safe is better :D

## DEVELOPMENT
The project can create multiple notifications with different timings handled indipendently

## EXECUTION
1. Point to the folder containing the project
2. run `$ python3 src/main.py`

# Updates
I had man things to work on during these weeks, but finally I managed to have time to build a simple but proper GUI for this program

As you can see, you can set different notifications with specific timings and messages and add and remove them as you want, in order to easily manage them without using the command line


## FURTHER DEVELPMENTS
Possible further developments:
1. Create Windows OS support
2. Add pause and play buttons
